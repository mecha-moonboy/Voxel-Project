# Kybus Voxel Engine
A lightweight C++ engine focusing on simulation scale and modular organization over graphics. 

This project was begun as a foundation to a larger, more ambitious passion project which will not be described presently.

The telos here is to put aside flair and focus completely on the mechanical capacity of the engine to generate large scale voxel terrain and objects that can be generated, rendered, and edited in-game with ease.

## Features:
- Cube

## Planned Features:
- Rendering:
    - Color lightmaps
    - Transparent blocks
    - Texture rotation
    - Block texture types (one texture, topside textures, etc.)
- Voxel areas:
    - Scalability
    - LOD
    - Destructibility
    - Physics
    - Moving voxel areas (for vehicles and mechanisms)
- Procedural 16x16 and 8x8 block textures
- Terrain generation:
    - Climate maps
    - Altitude curves
    - Rivers
